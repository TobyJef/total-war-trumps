        <h2>How To Win At Total War: Trumps</h2>
        <p>Take on the mantle of Shogun and plan your attack. A rival Daimyo is challenging your position as Supreme
            Ruler of Japan.</p>
        <p>Choose either your finest Archer, Samurai, Yari Spearmen or Cavalry. To fight for glory against this
            dishonourable foe.
        </p>
        <p>Archers rain down arrows onto Samurai from distance. The Samurai wield their katanas up close against Yari
            Spearmen.</p>
        <p>Use Yari Spearmen to hold off charging Cavalry. Or close the gap against far away Archers with a Cavalry
            attack.</p>
        <p>Best your rival to maintain your dynasty or face the ultimate punishment.</p>
        <p>The first player to 3 Victories will win the campaign.</p>
        <p>Can you defend your Kingdom?</p>
