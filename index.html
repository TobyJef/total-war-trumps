        <h2>How To Win At Total War: Trumps</h2>
        <p>Take on the mantle of Shogun and plan your attack. A rival Daimyo is challenging your position for Supreme Ruler of Japan.
            Choose either your finest Archer, Samurai, Yari Spearmen or Cavalry. To fight for glory against this dishonourable foe.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Archers rain down arrows on Samurai from afar. Samurai wield their swords up close against Yari Spearmen.
            Use Yari Spearmen to hold off charging Cavalry. Close the gap against far away Archers with a Cavalry
            attack.</p>
           <p>Can you defend your Kingdom?</p>-
        - best of 3 or 5?
