        <h2>How To Win At Total War: Trumps</h2>
        <p>Take on the mantle of Shogun and plan your attack. Choose your warrior but pick wisely,
            as a rival Daimyo is challenging your position for ruler of Japan. Choose from one of Archer,
            Samurai, Yari Spearmen or Cavalry. Archers rain down arrows on Samurai from afar.
            Samurai weild their swords up close against Yari Spearmen. Hold off charging Cavalry with your Yari
            Spearmen. Close the gap against far away Archers with a Cavalry attack.</p>- win-order image - best of 3?
