Total War Trumps

Total War Trumps is a game based on the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. But given a new twist by basing your choices from the hit real time strategy game, Total War: Shogun 2. Tally your score and prove you are the superior commander against the computer by picking one of four units and see who trumps who.

Similar in logic to Rock, Paper, Scissors where Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper and Paper beats Rock. Total War Trumps works on the same logic of superiority. In this game, the units consist of Archers, Samurai, Yari Spearmen and Cavalry.
Archers trump Samurai, Samurai trump Yari Spearmen, Yari Spearmean trump Cavalry and finally Cavalry trumps Archers.

Future Improvements

- For a future update it would be my goal to add a more units, adding complexity to the game.
- I would also like to include a drop down option, allowing players to change the time period of the in game units   
  to further expand the roster. i.e. A Roman Empire update, Roman Urban Cohorts taking place of Sword Samurai.
