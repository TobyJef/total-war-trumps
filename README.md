Future Improvements

- For a future update it would be my goal to add a more units, adding complexity to the game.
- I would also like to include a drop down option, allowing players to change the time period of the in game units   
  to further expand the roster. i.e. A Roman Empire update, Roman Urban Cohorts taking place of Sword Samurai.
